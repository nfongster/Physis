# Physis
A general-purpose physics simulator.

## Setup
Currently, you will need Visual Studio (I have developed using VS 2022) and/or msbuild to compile this source code.  There are also some external dependencies not committed to source control that must be added.

1. Create a folder called 'extern' in your local repository.
2. TBD: add instructions for catch2, OpenGL, and pybind11
