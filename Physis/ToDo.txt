Make a simple GUI that does the following:
- Shows trajectory of particle in 2D under gravity
- Allows user to specify initial position and velocity
- Allows user to specify distance scale (e.g., window = 1 km across)
- Shows current velocity, position, acceleration, and elapsed time

Phases:
1. Console app
2. Python script (plot trajectory & compare w/ analytical sln)
3. GUI (no rendering)
4. OpenGL window
5. GUI + OpenGL window

Phase 1: Console app
- User specified r0 (m), v0 (m/s), a0 (m/s^2), t_total (sec), dt (sec)
- Handle user input robustly
- Option to read from file (save typing)
- Evolve system across t_total
- Add sequential patterns
  (1) Game Loop
      - Make engine abstract class with render/step virtual functions
      - Experiment with different parameter combinations
  (2) Double Buffer
- Show results in console
- Output results to log

Phase 2: Python app
- Research ways of linking C++ / Python (pybind11 or SWIG)
- Write Python script that plots actual trajectory vs. analytic solution
- Experiment with different parameters and write reports
- Resolve rounding errors (rf, vf actual != expected)
